                            <p>Alliance Health Partners LLC, doing business as Alliance Health, will introduce a direct to employer health benefits program to central Florida employers on October 1, 2020 with an effective date of January 1, 2021. </p>

<p>Alliance Health’s network includes 1,000+ independent physicians throughout central Florida, the Integrated Independent Physicians Network (IPN), as well as the Independent Ancillary Healthcare Network, (IAHN), an independent ancillary provider network throughout central Florida which consists of urgent care, imaging, lab, home health, durable medical equipment, weight loss centers, telehealth services, and home visit and patient monitoring services. </p>

<p>Alliance Health will provide a health benefits program that is accessible, personalized, focused on wellness and preventative care, and is cost effective for small to midsize employers. </p>

<p>The Alliance Health team has developed the skills, knowledge, systems, and capability of providing an alternative to high cost, high out of pocket health plans that are driving the cost out of reach for many employers; resulting in a catastrophic lack of care and low outcomes for patients with chronic conditions, which in turn results in more emergency room visits, unnecessary admissions, and even a higher cost of care.</p>

<p>Utilizing an independent healthcare delivery network such as Alliance Health, offers patients the highest quality of care and the lowest out of pocket costs, resulting in a higher patient satisfaction experience. </p>

<p>Alliance Health has partnered with a third-party administrator for claims processing and client management; a complete broker/agent network to educate and engage employers, an A+ rated reinsurer and underwriter to ensure solvency and cost management.  Independent Healthcare Partners (IHP) manages Alliance Health Partners LLC, and brings years of experience in health plan management, IPA development, medical management, and managing cost effective value-based health care plans. </p>

<p>Alliance Health’s benefit design programs will include a menu of health savings account plans, copay plans, as well as low out of pocket cost benefits for selected inpatient care. While Alliance Health brings a complete independent outpatient healthcare delivery network, Alliance has partnered with selected hospital systems in the central Florida area, combining a unique opportunity for employers, in offering a new and exciting health care experience for their employees and families.</p>

<p>In 2016, healthcare cost in the US was $3.3 Trillion – 17.9% of GDP, passing $10,000 per capita mark for the first time ever. According to CMS, by 2026, the figure is projected to grow to $5.7 Trillion – 19.8% of GDP. The answer to curbing and reversing the trend with respect to healthcare costs lies in large part to the movement towards more use of independent providers, delivering a significant cost savings for healthcare consumers.</p>

<p>More details and specific plan design and cost targeted toward individual employers will be identified at a later date, and upon employer requests for quotes. </p>

<p>The Alliance Health team is very excited to bring a new and innovative approach to central Florida employers, utilizing advanced analytics, comprehensive care management, and inclusive patient involvement in their care. Our core culture is “We Put You First” with the patient being the cornerstone of our program with a dedicated and experienced team you can trust standing with you.</p>
